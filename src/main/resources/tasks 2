 * how user should describe his expectations?:

 solution #1:
 - specifies tags that describes his wants,
 - user tags might be a part of many different services,
 so user will get recommendations

 implementation:
 - user specifies expected services tags,
 - we will create additional table UserExpectedServiceTag that will
 match users with tags,
 - there won't be any
