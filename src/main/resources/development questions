# AT THE BEGINNING JUST TEST DIFFERENT CASES

 * create couple users - done,

 * create a method for registering services:
 - create that method in initial data loader class, because
 this is like an initial data aspect,
 - I won't have to load users and set the data to them later, but
 I will be able to do that in the method class,

 + maybe create a list of registered services and set them to users:
 - create a separate method to create that list

 * create a method for registering what a user might want - TODO:
 - this will be in data init class, I will create separate method for that,
 - those all gonna be initial data type methods,

 * user creates a group in an init class:
 + is this should be in an init class?
 - not neccesserly, because I can get a user and then
 set a group to that user,
 - not every user has to have his own group, he might join this group in a method

 + is it really matter where i put this code?:
 - yes, because I want to test only realtions betwenn groups

 + should I create more users? - yes

 * append many users to one group:
 - simulate relations between them,
 - simulate creating obligations,
 - synchronize entire process of adding money,
 removing money from a group
 - exchanging money between groups - see if this is really possible,
 - define interest rate for a group
