 * what is the main goal?:
 - is it creating an application for local communities or creating alternative debt market?,
 - play on their emotions all the time,

 * how to create money:
 + strategy #1 (creating money on demand):
 - we have a group that has a user, he has a demand for service,
 - first we negotiate a one unit price, we do not negotiate the amount of units,
 - we have the demand indicator, a user sets demand, and after that another user might
 issue a bond that
 - this a bit not good solutio, because money are created, so this money are
 transferred to a bond issuer a bit earlier
 - it is not a good solution

 questions:
 + If you want to use this application then you
 have to create money out of your work
 for society, you have to give something via this system,
 so there is no way that you can get something for nothing

 examples:
 + party group:
 - people are doing something to organize a party,
 - I am gonna make balloons, he will swep the floor, but still

 * How to introduce a new user into a group?
 + strategy #1:
 - do something for others
 - a group members estimates one user work unit price,
 - group estimates amount of units that one user might receive in an exchange for our services,
 - they have to estimate the potential limit of how many units they might issue - 25 - 35,
 - people could become more involved in what they do for their community,
 they would feel this power,
 - they would feel responsible for their communities,
 - they would like it, because this is how they can make other people life better
 in the reality, not just behind package,
 - after that people will see the real impact of all people
 - you can join a group just by showing your engagement, not if you just know, it does not matter
 if you know me or i know you, I can meet you if you need people like me,
 - this aspect about creating bonds on the fly, when you really want,
 you create debt when you feel ok with it's ok,
 - you just go outside and say, damn it is a time to create some money,
 - today we are not gonna say give me some money man,
 we gonna say gonna make some cash brother
 - today we wont light up any fire in any barrel we gonna create some real money,
 - introduce those negotiations between people, where they can interact with themselves,
 - this system has to be spectacular, has to be different, has to give those emotions to people
 has to give the real power, has to very,
 - this is how young and pour people might learn about economics,
 about how this world works for real,
 - the best way to learn it is just to do it,

 + strategy #2 - for societies:
 - just create that for normal people,
 - create that for people that do not have companies,
 - this will be much easier under legislation terms,
 - this will be just for people,
 - in normal world this would not worked,
 but we are not living in normal world.
 This might reduce the amount of unemployment.
 Those people might work for society, if society would like it,
 - but those activities are not for people they can not buy anything

 problems:
 - one user might buy all users services, so other users have to be very care full, so a lot time much needed,
 - new users might say about stupid activities that you can maybe do in your local society,
 - they would create a lot of mess (group would have to look very carefully) what they are doing
 for what money, for what amount of units, but stupid things you can do everywhere
 + some activities might be just for overall society ()

 * Create a transaction model, a model that will represent a success full purchase:
 - for sure i need to have all transactions
 - Transaction model
 - how many units,
 - btw. a purchase produces a Purchase Coupon,
 - save this coupon,
 - return a coupon, redirect to a view,
 - poll for a coupon

 questions:
 + why do I need this model:
 - id, user id, bond id, amount of units, purchase_date,
