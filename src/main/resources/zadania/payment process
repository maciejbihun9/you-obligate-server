 * a coupon:
 - has to be attached with specified bond,
 - this allows to make this coupon as a real asset,
 - normally you would make a purchase of some service or a product, but
 here you buy a service like an asset,
 - normally you buy shares of a company if you think that those capabilities might be use full,
 but having a company assets is more risky

 * create bond coupons:
 solution #1 (bond coupons):
 - this is like a bond certificate coupon,
 - each buyer might be able to receive a bond coupon after he clicks make a purchase,
 - after purchase a user receives a coupon, bond loses one service unit, user loses money,
 - user will have coupons list with all coupons from all bonds from all obligation groups,
 - he can go to a service issuer, give him a code from that coupon,
 - this coupon is destroyed, service is executed,
 - deleting a coupon is in the best interest of a bond issuer, because if he does not do that,
 then this coupon will still be active and another user will be able to use i to make a purchase
 - when a user goes to an issuer then he generates a code for amount of units he wants to pay,
 - this coupon won't have any date,
 - during a purchase I will be able to specify number of service units
 then a code will be generated,
 - this coupons will be a user assets,
 - this is a bit advanced and interesting,
 - a user is a able to buy a coupon
 and keep it for extended period of
 time or just buy stuff immidietly

 advantages:
 - I buy a coupon, so I can reserve one service unit of work,
 - I do not know when I would be able to use it, so that is why I am reserving this item,
 but this is like an asset,
 - a user is able to sell it for much more expensive price,
 - a user is able to sell it other users, but noone knows what is the price of it, especaially users from
 other groups

 disadvantages:
 - we have to pay before actual service,
 - we have have some sneaky codes generated,
 - we have to make couple steps to buy a service or a product,
 - create a feature to hash this info
 - we have to buy a coupon and then
 generate this fucking hash code,
 send this hashcode to make a purchase,
 - after coupon was buy, it might be sell,
 - a person can sell it for much more expensive price,

 questions:

 + everything comes to a situation where I have estimate barter exchange rates:

 + how a user from other groups or just
 single is able to buy a unit service
 - maybe they can just negotiate with each other,
 - it would turned out that
 - they would have to negotiate between themselves final prices

 + maybe I can issue this coupon in the secondary market:
 - when I buy some service on the primary market then this is my
 no matter what happens, this is my, so i do not have to sell it
 to people from my group
 - I can sell it to people from other groups, but!!!,
 for what

 + should bond know about all active coupons?:
 - if coupons are still active then bond can not be closed - an issuer is still obligated to pay those bills,
 - so bond would remain open even for an extended period of time,

 + what would happen on the issuer side?:
 - coupons might be issued for bonds,
 - A bond will lose one unit of work
 - bond does not has to know how many open coupons are on the market

 + what a person might do with a coupon?:
 - I can have this coupon for extended period of time,
 because this coupon might be worth,
 - I can keep this coupon for longer, extended period of time,
 - this would be like an asset, this is like gate
 - bond might have maturity date until might be executed,
 so that student is not obligating for 10 years when his capabilities might be very high and worth a lot,
 - it won't be like I will give you what I did rent, because the inflation might burn a lot of money in this case

 solution #2 (without any coupons):
 - a user goes to a bond issuer,
 - bond issuer just do a service,
 - a user pays using his money via my system,
 - he sees available units,
 - pays for a service unit before a service
 - buy service unit
 - so instead of using normal money, electronic money a user and issuer will use this system,
 - this might be an alternative way to pay for a service

 advantages:
 - it is very easy,
 - no created additional assets

 examples:
 - user enters the booking.com page, orders an accomodation,
 then goes into someones house and after that pays using his money,

 questions:
 + how a user pays for this service?:
 - an issuer generates a code and gives a user, user uses it to pay for a service in the
 bond item in the list
 - user tipes in, fills this blank place and a service is paid

 + how much time I am spending on this planning?
 - I am spanding a lot time on this fuckin planning
